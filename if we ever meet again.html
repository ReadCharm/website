    <h2><b>The story is set during a year abroad program in Shanghai and follows two main characters: Farrah Lin, an aspiring interior designer who dreams of falling in love, and Blake Ryan, a 
        former college football star who is disillusioned with love.
        Farrah is a hopeful romantic, while Blake is cynical, believing that love is a con. Their personalities clash, as she is a virgin seeking a fairytale romance, and he avoids commitments, 
        particularly with someone inexperienced. Despite their differences, they find themselves irresistibly drawn to each other.
        As they navigate their time in Shanghai, their relationship evolves from friendship to romance, filled with moments of passion and connection. However, they are aware that their time 
        together is limited, as external forces threaten to pull them apart. The narrative emphasizes that sometimes, even the strongest love cannot overcome all obstacles.
        The novel is characterized by a slow-burn romance, vivid descriptions of the Shanghai setting, and relatable character development. It captures the essence of first love and the 
        challenges that come with it, ultimately leading to a poignant realization about love's complexities.<br>
