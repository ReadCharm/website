    <h2><b>Jack Torrance is a struggling writer and recovering alcoholic who hopes that the isolation of the Overlook Hotel will help him finish his play and reconnect with his family. 
        However, the hotel has a dark history filled with violence and supernatural occurrences. Danny, who possesses psychic abilities known as "the shining," begins to experience
         terrifying visions as the hotel’s malevolent forces begin to influence Jack's sanity.
        As winter sets in and the family becomes snowbound, Jack's mental state deteriorates under the hotel's influence, leading him to violent impulses against Wendy and Danny. 
        The hotel's supernatural elements manipulate Jack, echoing the fate of a previous caretaker, Delbert Grady, who murdered his family.
        Danny's psychic abilities allow him to communicate with Dick Hallorann, the hotel’s cook, who also shares the shining. As Jack succumbs to the hotel's power, Wendy and Danny
         must escape his increasingly dangerous behavior. The climax culminates in a confrontation where Danny manages to outsmart Jack, leading to a tragic conclusion for Jack as 
         the hotel itself is destroyed.<br>
        The novel is noted for its deep psychological insights and the portrayal of a family under extreme stress, making it a classic in the horror genre. It has been adapted into 
        a famous film directed by Stanley Kubrick and has inspired various sequels and adaptations, including King’s own follow-up novel, Doctor Sleep.
        The Shining is not only a tale of horror but also a profound exploration of personal demons, making it a significant work in Stephen King's oeuvre and in the horror 
        literature landscape.</b></h2>
