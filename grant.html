    <h2><b>The biography begins with Grant's early life in rural Ohio, where he was born into a Methodist and abolitionist family.
         Despite his initial ambitions to be a mathematics professor, he was enrolled at West Point by his father.<br>
          Grant's military career began during the Mexican-American War, where he gained valuable experience. However, his struggles with alcoholism led to a resignation from the army.
        As the Civil War erupted, Grant rejoined the military, distinguishing himself with a relentless and strategic approach that led to significant victories, including the pivotal surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House, effectively ending the war. Chernow emphasizes Grant's commitment to civil rights, highlighting his efforts during Reconstruction to protect African Americans and combat the Ku Klux Klan.
        Despite his military successes, Grant's presidency was plagued by scandals and corruption among his administration, though Chernow defends Grant's personal integrity and dedication to civil rights.<br>
        After leaving office, Grant faced financial difficulties and wrote his memoirs, which were completed shortly before his death from throat cancer in 1885.<br>
