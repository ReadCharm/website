    <h2><b>The Blackwood family has been ostracized by their small village following a tragic incident six years prior, where most of the family died from arsenic poisoning during a
         dinner. Constance was accused of the murders but was acquitted, leaving the sisters and Uncle Julian to live in seclusion. Merricat, who frequently ventures into town for
          groceries, faces hostility from the villagers, who harbor resentment and suspicion towards the Blackwoods.
        Merricat is portrayed as a quirky and unreliable narrator, with a penchant for magical thinking and a deep protective instinct for her sister. She engages in rituals and 
        believes she can ward off danger through her actions. The sisters' isolated life is disrupted when their cousin Charles arrives, bringing with him a desire to reclaim the
         family estate and disrupt their routine.
        As Charles attempts to integrate himself into their lives, Merricat feels threatened and resorts to increasingly desperate measures to protect her sister and their way of 
        life. The tension escalates, culminating in a catastrophic fire that destroys their home and forces the sisters to confront the villagers' wrath. In the aftermath, they
         retreat further into isolation, finding a twisted sense of happiness in their new reality.<br>

         gradually revealed.
