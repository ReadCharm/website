    <h2><b>The novel begins with Abraham "Abe" and Dan, who bond over their shared experiences of loss. Both men are struggling to cope with the deaths of their wives and find solace 
        in fishing. After some time, Dan suggests they explore Dutchman's Creek, a location rumored to have a dark history and the potential to bring back lost loved ones.
        As they venture to the creek, they are warned by locals about its dangers but choose to ignore the warnings. Upon arriving, they encounter the Fisherman, an ancient being who
         is attempting to catch a primordial creature known as the Leviathan. The Fisherman offers them a choice: assist him in his quest to capture the Leviathan, which could
          potentially allow them to reclaim their lost loved ones, or resist him and face dire consequences.
