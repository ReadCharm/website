    <h2><b>"Korea and India: A Study in Interaction of Two Civilizations" is a book edited by Tan Chung that explores the historical and cultural interactions between Korea and India 
        from ancient times to the modern era. Here is a summary of the key points:
        Legend of the Indian Princess
        The book examines the legend of Suriratna, an Indian princess from Ayodhya who sailed to Korea in 48 AD and married King Kim Suro of the Gaya kingdom. She took the name Heo 
        Hwang-ok and bore the king several sons, two of whom kept her family name. Many Koreans trace their lineage back to this legendary royal couple.
        Cultural Exchanges
        The book delves into the various cultural exchanges and connections between the two civilizations over the centuries. It discusses how Indian culture, particularly Buddhism,
         was transmitted to Korea and influenced its art, architecture, and philosophy.<br>
        Historical Interactions
        "Korea and India" provides insights into the historical interactions between the two countries, including diplomatic relations, trade, and people-to-people contacts. The book
         situates these interactions within the broader context of East Asian and world history.
        Significance of the Book
        This collection is significant as it is one of the first comprehensive works to examine the Korea-India relationship from a historical and cultural perspective. It highlights
         the shared experiences and connections between the two Asian civilizations, which have often been overlooked in favor of China and Japan.
        The book is valuable for scholars and general readers interested in exploring the lesser-known aspects of Korea and India's past interactions and the potential for future 
        engagement between the two countries based on their shared heritage</b></h2>
